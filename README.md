# HandHandwritten Devanagari Numeral Recognition

This project focuses on building a system for recognizing handwritten Devanagari numerals. Devanagari numerals are the numerical symbols used in the Devanagari script, primarily in languages such as Hindi, Nepali, and Marathi.The system will take an input image containing a handwritten Devanagari numeral and classify it into one of the ten classes representing the Devanagari numerals from 0 to 9.

# Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project consists of handwritten digit images, each with a resolution of 28x28 pixels. The dataset contains 17,000 images for training and 3,000 images for testing, which were obtained from a folder on the researcher's desktop. The images are in grayscale and have been preprocessed to have pixel values between 0 and 1. The goal of this project is to develop a fully connected neural network that can accurately classify the digits in the images.
